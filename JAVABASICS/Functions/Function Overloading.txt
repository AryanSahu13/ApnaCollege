Function Overloading:

It means that multiple functions with same name but different parameters.

Say,
multiply 1 (int a, int b);
multiply 2 (float a, float b);
multiply 3 (double a, double b);
multiply 4 (int a, int b, int c);

But, it is confusing when calling the method, whether we are calling int, or float, or double, or .....

So, to avoid the confusion, we have same names, but each with different set of parameters. Like,

multiply (int a, int b);
multiply (float a, float b);
multiply (double a, double b);
multiply (int a, int b, int c);
