Definition of an Array:

List of elements of the same type placed in a contiguous memory location.

In c++ and java, these arrays start with -based indexing.

Eg: You cannot make a value with diff types like float, int, string (Mango, 4.9, 8) --> cannot be an array.
But, same type can be, like:

i. int = [1,2,3,4,5]
ii. str = ["Mango", "Apple", "Banana"]
iii. float = [4.9, 6.9, 8.8]

OPerations - create, input, output, update
